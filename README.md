## LDTS_<03><07> - <Space_Shooter>

In this game it will be possible to control a spaceship in order to avoid objects that can cause damage to the ship, namely meteors and eliminate enemy ships, each with a certain amount of life and attack damage of its own. To combat them, our ship will be able to obtain certain power-ups over the course of the game, which can range from a temporary (or permanent) increase in attack damage, number of weapons and life, and increased movement speed.
The objective of the game is to get the highest score possible by destroying enemy ships with the help of power-ups, ending when our ship's health reaches zero.
This project was developed by Miguel Guerrinha (up202205038@fe.up.pt), Rui Cruz (up202208011@fe.up.pt) and Sheila Albino (up202109258@fe.up.pt).


### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

The game will have a ship that moves and fires projectiles with a certain amount of health. The meteors move downwards and can fire projectiles or just fall towards our ship. Each object in the game will have an amount of life and whenever it is hit, that life decreases. Each time our ship defeats an enemy, the game's score increases.

**Examples**:

- **Jumping** - The game character will jump when the space bar key is pressed.
- **Getting hidden coins** - When the game character hits a platform from below (by jumping beneath it) it will smash that segment of the platform and will get any coins that may exist hidden there.

### PLANNED FEATURES
In the future we will be able to add power-ups and be able to gain certain special attributes, increase the amount of life and as the game progresses the speed of the enemies will increase.
### DESIGN

> This section should be organized in different subsections, each describing a different design problem that you had to solve during the project. Each subsection should be organized in four different parts:

- **Problem in Context.** The description of the design context and the concrete problem that motivated the instantiation of the pattern. Someone else other than the original developer should be able to read and understand all the motivations for the decisions made. When refering to the implementation before the pattern was applied, don’t forget to [link to the relevant lines of code](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet) in the appropriate version.
- **The Pattern.** Identify the design pattern to be applied, why it was selected and how it is a good fit considering the existing design context and the problem at hand.
- **Implementation.** Show how the pattern roles, operations and associations were mapped to the concrete design classes. Illustrate it with a UML class diagram, and refer to the corresponding source code with links to the relevant lines (these should be [relative links](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes#relative-links-and-image-paths-in-readme-files). When doing this, always point to the latest version of the code.
- **Consequences.** Benefits and liabilities of the design after the pattern instantiation, eventually comparing these consequences with those of alternative solutions.

**Example of one of such subsections**:

#### THE JUMP ACTION OF THE KANGAROOBOY SHOULD BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON ITS STATE

**Problem in Context**

There was a lot of scattered conditional logic when deciding how the KangarooBoy should behave when jumping, as the jumps should be different depending on the items that came to his possession during the game (an helix will alow him to fly, driking a potion will allow him to jump double the height, etc.). This is a violation of the **Single Responsability Principle**. We could concentrate all the conditional logic in the same method to circumscribe the issue to that one method but the **Single Responsability Principle** would still be violated.

**The Pattern**

We have applied the **State** pattern. This pattern allows you to represent different states with different subclasses. We can switch to a different state of the application by switching to another implementation (i.e., another subclass). This pattern allowed to address the identified problems because […].

**Implementation**

The following figure shows how the pattern’s roles were mapped to the application classes.

These classes can be found in the following files:

- [Character](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/Character.java)
- [JumpAbilityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/JumpAbilityState.java)
- [DoubleJumpState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/DoubleJumpState.java)
- [HelicopterState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/HelicopterState.java)
- [IncreasedGravityState](https://web.fe.up.pt/~arestivo/page/courses/2021/lpoo/template/src/main/java/IncreasedGravityState.java)

**Consequences**

The use of the State Pattern in the current design allows the following benefits:

- The several states that represent the character’s hability to jump become explicit in the code, instead of relying on a series of flags.
- We don’t need to have a long set of conditional if or switch statements associated with the various states; instead, polimorphism is used to activate the right behavior.
- There are now more classes and instances to manage, but still in a reasonable number.

#### KNOWN CODE SMELLS

> This section should describe 3 to 5 different code smells that you have identified in your current implementation.

### TESTING

- Screenshot of coverage report.
- Link to mutation testing report.

### SELF-EVALUATION

> In this section describe how the work regarding the project was divided between the students. In the event that members of the group do not agree on a work distribution, the group should send an email to the teacher explaining the disagreement.

**Example**:

- John Doe: 40%
- Jane Doe: 60%
